Documentation for Project 8

	Most of the project was going smoothly until i got to dealing out the cards...
i couldn't get my function to work to copy cards to the member array hand for my 
player class.I realized after many hours that i didn't want the scope resoloution 
operator in my class.h file.  this was throwing an error that lead to another error 
and it just became a huge mess.
	After figuring that out and being able to finally deal the cards the only
difficulty came in the sheer amount of new code to write.  It was also difficult to 
keep track of what variables were being used for what and which to use in the function
and loop parameters.  Most mistakes made during this phase however where easy to remedy
and once the original problem of not being able to deal cards using my sethand function
was resolved the rest of the project was much more enjoyable and interesting.
